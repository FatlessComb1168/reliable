# Reliable
Generate passwords by a master password.

Reliable is a program that generates a set of 30 very strong passwords by your master password. No need to remember complex passwords: all you have to do is come up with a master password and remember it. The program will generate a set of passwords that you can use on different sites.

The generated passwords will not be stored on your device (unless you want them to), which makes Reliable even more secure.

The main thing is not to tell anyone (except those you trust) your master password and keep it in your head or in a place difficult for outsiders but accessible to you. Make up a completely new master password that is different from everyone else and that no one knows but you.
